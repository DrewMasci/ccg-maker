# README

This is the example CCG maker project by Drew Masci. The purpose of this project
is to demostrate coding ability for Ruby on Rails, a language not touched
previously by Drew.

This project is used to create Collectable Card Game cards. Upon visiting the
site create a user to log into the system. After that you will see a list of
cards created already. However there is no art for these cards.

In order to create a card, simply visit the landing page of the site or click
on the "Cards List" link located to the top left. Then click on the "Create New
Card" button. After that you'll be presented with a screen listing the various
features of a card you can populate.

After entering all the details you'll be returned to the "List of Cards" where
you'll find you're newly added card.
